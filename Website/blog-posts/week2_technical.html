		<h2><strong>The Box Model</strong></h2>

		<h4><em><strong>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</strong></em></h4>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Margin</strong> &#45; is the padding outside of a border, between the border and the edge of the page.  Adjusting this is useful to keep a clear edge around the page.</li>
				<li><strong>Border</strong> &#45; is the visual border you see on the page, and can be easily styled for colour, thickness and format. </li>
				<li><strong>Padding</strong> &#45; is the padding inside of a border, between the contents and the border.  Adjusting this is useful to keep content text spaced from the edge of the content box.</li>
			</ul>

		<h4><em><strong>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</strong></em></h4>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Relative</strong> &#45; this type of positioning automatically adjusts itself to itself, if you include a positioning attribute, e.g. bottom 10px where it will shift its position up 10px from where it would usually sit.</li>
				<li><strong>Absolute</strong> &#45; this enables a page element to positioned exactly where you would like to to be, i.e. removing itself from the flow of elements on the page.</li>
				<li><strong>Fixed</strong> &#45; this type of positioning is relative to the viewport (i.e. browser) and so the page stays where it is, stifling scrolling activities, and is pretty rare as a result.</li>
				<li><strong>Static</strong> &#45; this is the default for every page element.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2><strong>Elements and structure</strong></h2>

		<h4><em><strong>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</strong></em></h4>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Classes</strong> &#45; are not unique with the same class being usable on multiple elements.  You can also use multiple classes on the same element.</li>
				<li><strong>Ids</strong> &#45; are unique as each element can only have one ID (and each page can only have one element with that ID).</li>
			</ul>

		<h4><em><strong>What does it mean to display inline code vs block code?</strong></em></h4>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Inline code</strong> &#45; is code that flows along with the text content, is typically shorter in length as these often address more minor amendments, e.g. setting a word to bold.</li>
				<li><strong>Block code</strong> &#45; is code that takes up the full width available in its container (i.e. div or span etc), and so require formatting to ensure the contents fit within the container size.</li>
			</ul>
