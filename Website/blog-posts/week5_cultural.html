	<h2>Pairing and Giving</h2>

		<p>I have found that the anxiety I have generated ahead of a pairing session &#45; as I face meeting a new person, working with them on a challenging assignment, an become vulnerable in exposing my skills (or lack of them) &#45; has been completely off&#45;set by the really positive experiences I&#39;ve had.</p>

		<p>Everyone &#45; without fail &#45; has been friendly, open, generous with their time, expertise and kindess throughout the pairing experience.</p>

		<p>Whilst I have felt (and because of my reduced prep time, is probably the reality) &#34;chasing my tail&#34;, I have gone into the pairing sessions feeling fearful of disappointing the other party.  However, whilst I have learnt tons from my fellow students, I have also been able to educate also, as I have found that I have known tricks and tips that others don&#39;t yet know.  Or indeed have been able to provide a good sounding board to facilitate critical thinking.</p>

		<p>The pairing experience is a defining feature of DBC, and is also an aspect of the Sharing Economy.  As defined by Widipedia:</p>

		<p><em>The sharing economy (sometimes also referred to as the peer&#45;to&#45;peer economy, mesh, collaborative economy, collaborative consumption) is a socio&#45;economic system built around the sharing of human and physical resources.</em></p> 

		<p>Whilst innovative young tech companies are benefiting from the commercialisation of this sharing economy, the fundamental principles remain the same &#45; help thy neighbour.  Help them with stuff, with effort, with favours, with support, with mentorship, with education&#46;&#46;&#46;  And I think it's a wonderful way to learn.</p>
