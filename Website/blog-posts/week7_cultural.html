	<h1>Values</h1>

	<h2>When thriving in the workplace, the following values come to mind...</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Accomplishment</li>
			<li>Achievement</li>
			<li>Close relationships</li>
			<li>Creativity</li>
			<li>Inspiration</li>
			<li>Effectiveness</li>
			<li>Efficiency</li>
			<li>Leadership</li>
			<li>Meaningful work</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Meaningful work</h2>

	<p>I have been fortunate enough to perform a number of roles that have been directly impactful on both individuals and society as a whole.</p>

	<p>In general, I try to seek out meaningful work.  My approach has been to mix it up as sadly more meaningful work is not always available or viable.</p>

	<p>I am often asked for advice on career direction and how to balance the pursuit of meaningful work with other career needs, such as skills, industry experience and improving networks.</p>

	<p>I think that meaningful work is an ambition we all have, albeit are abilities to realise this for ourselves could be constrained by a whole number of factors that may or may not be within our control.  I think this common ambition rises above stereotype threats (arising from being a minority in the workplace).</p>
