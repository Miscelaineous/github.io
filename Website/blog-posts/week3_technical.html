			<h4>What is Javascript?</h4>

			<ul>

				<li>JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, programming language designed for performing user interactive tasks, such as filling in forms, sending requests and receiving bespoke information through the web page.<br></li>

				<li>It is an interpreted language, so unlike compiled languages such as C++, no special program or compiler is needed to create the code.  You can code straight onto any plain text editor, such as Sublime.  When creating a web-page, it's convention to have a html page, linking to a separate css page and a js page, saved as a .js file.</li>  

			</ul>

		</div>

			<h4>What's the good stuff?  Why is it so popular?</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Javascript is object &#45; orientated, meaning everything from elements to variables can be treated as an object, making access to and the ability to manipulate the code, easy and straight &#45; forward.</li>

				<li>Javascript is easy, once you know the conventions, the code can be easily added to your website by adding and linking in a .js file.</li>

				<li>Javascript is supported by most browsers (excluding IE, which is fast being excluded from the web &#45; app development world) and as such, is fast becoming ubiquitous.</li>

				<li>Javascript's reputation has turned around from being simply a page presentation controller through to a full-feature programming language.</li>

			<h4>What's the bad stuff?</h4>
			
			<ul>
						
				<li><strong>Bloating</strong> &#45;  Javascript can severly bloat web pages if included within a html page, often adding many more lines of code, particularly if the page creates dynamic content above the norm.  </li>

				<li><strong>Compatibility</strong> &#45; some client-side browsers can interpret Javascript differently.  This is becoming less of an issues as time passes.</li>

				<li><strong>Security</strong> &#45; Javascript snippets, if appended to web pages, can also be used to exploit a users system.</li>

It creates a different model of page, using nodes, to create a DOM tree.  This is the DOM!  JS manipulates all code via the DOM, using different conventions to HTML and CSS code.</div>
