	<h2><strong>Data Structures</strong></h2>
	
	<h4><em><strong>Overview</strong></em></h4>

		<p>Data Structures are a natural way for humans to order the world, both in reality and conceptually.  This &#34;order&#34; is represented in computer science with the translation of these concepts to Data Structures that enable data to be read, written and manipulated.<br>Some key Data Structures include:</p>
			<ul>

			<li><strong>Sets</strong> &#45; this is an unordered collection of objects that are not indexed, do not have any keys and are not stored in a sequenced manner.  These are good for very quick look-ups to check if an element is a member of the set or not, and to identify any missing members or duplicates.</li>

			<li><strong>Arrays</strong> &#45;this is a collection of data, of any type &#45; integers, strings, Booleans etc &#45; that are stored in an ordered list, accessible and manipulated by an index, attributed automatically to each element.  Its strengths include the ease of creation, albeit the data does need sorting ahead of any useful methods being applies.  Another benefit is its ability to mix elements, albeit this can slow down performance materially, particularly if trying to sort data, which a computer will do in a linear way (i.e. will inspect every item).</li>
				
			<li><strong>Stacks and queues</strong> &#45;this is where data is stacked one on top of the other in a LIFO (Last In First Out) or FIFO (First In First Out) manner, and is accessed in a LIFO and FIFO manner.  It's simplicity is it's strength as it allows for the existence or not of an element to be easily identifiable.  It's weakness is that data can only be accessed on a LIFO/FIFO basis and so identifying individual elements within the stack is not possible.</li>

			<li><strong>Hash tables, also known as Associative Arrays</strong> &#45;this is one of the most dynamic and efficient data structures around.  The index is replaced by a key to generate key&#45;value pairs, establishing a relationship between a key and its value that arrays cannot achieve (with no relationship between an index an its value).  Data is passed through a Data Function to result in an integer which serves as a key to that particular bit of data.  This enables speedy identification and accessibility of items, that do not need indexing or ordering ahead of storage.  The primary disadvantage is the potential for overhead.</li>

			</ul>

	<h4><em><strong>How they can model the real world</strong></em></h4>

		<ul>

			<li><strong>Sets</strong> &#45; a good use would be the electoral role to ensure no duplicate names on the list.</li>

			<li><strong>Arrays</strong> &#45; combining lists of names and attributes, e.g. a telephone directory.</li>
				
			<li><strong>Stacks and queues</strong> &#45; an example is printing, whereby a computer (or number of computers) queue up to print.</li>

			<li><strong>Hash tables</strong> &#45;great for adding and deleting items from very large databases.</li>

			</ul>

	<h2><strong>Classes</strong></h2>
	
	<h4><em><strong>Overview</strong></em></h4>

		<p>Classes are a concept, idea or blueprint, such as an architect's plan to build a house.  Ruby has in-built Classes that are objects, as are all elements in Ruby.  Core Classes include Strings, Numbers, Dates, Math etc.  They all point back to the Main Class or Main Object, which is the root class for Ruby.  It is possible to create Class Objects at the Core Class Objects level, but it is not a common occurence.</p>  

	<h4><strong>How to use Classes</strong></h4>

		<p>Classes are not a tangible concept until an object is created, an "object instance", which points back to that Class.</p>

		<p>Ruby has in-built Classes that have a large number of methods attached to them, depending on the class.  E.g. the Number class has a range of math methods that are in-built, e.g. FixNum or to_s.  The String class has a range of text-related methods that are in-built.  E.g. .reverse, .count, .capitalize.  These methods cannot be used in classes to which they do not relate, e.g. a FixNum method cannot be used on a String Class.</p>

  	<h4><strong>When to use Classes</strong></h4>

		<p>For any object instance, instance variable or instance method to be applied, a Class must first be defined.  Without a Class definition, any attempt to run a code against any of the above will return an error.  Variables and Methods can be attached directly to the Class vs a Class instance, but this is unusual.</p>
