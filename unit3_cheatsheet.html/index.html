    <h2>Performing a conditional search</h2>

    <h3>The SQL SELECT Statement</h3>

    <p>
        The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
        The result is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
        Select specific columns from table:
    </p>

    <blockquote>SELECT column_name(s)</br>
    FROM table_name;
</blockquote>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT CustomerName, City</br>
FROM Customers;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>(*) selects ALL rows/columns:</br>
SELECT * FROM table_name;
</blockquote>

<h4>Example</h4>
<blockquote>SELECT * FROM Customers;</blockquote>

<h3>The SQL SELECT DISTINCT statement</h3>

<p>
In a table, a column may contain many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values. The DISTINCT keyword can be used to return only distinct (different) values.
</p>

<blockquote>SQL SELECT DISTINCT Syntax</br>
SELECT DISTINCT column_name,column_name
</br>
FROM table_name;
</blockquote>

<h4>Example</h4>
<blockquote>SELECT DISTINCT City</br>
FROM Customers;
</blockquote>

<h3>The SQL WHERE statement</h3>

<blockquote>SELECT column_name,column_name</br>
FROM table_name
</br>
WHERE column_name operator value;
</blockquote>

<h4>Example</h4>
<blockquote>SELECT * FROM Customers</br>
WHERE Country='Mexico'; => (must use quotes around strings)
</blockquote>

<h4>Example</h4>
<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE CustomerID=1; => (Don’t need quotes for a number)
</blockquote>

<p>
Operators in The WHERE Clause
        The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Operator</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>= Equal</li>
<li>
&#60; &#62; Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
</li>
<li>&#62; Greater than</li>
<li>&#60; Less than</li>
<li>&#62;&#61; Greater than or equal</li>
<li>&#60;&#61; Less than or equal</li>
<li>BETWEEN Between an inclusive range</li>
<li>LIKE Search for a pattern</li>
<li>IN To specify multiple possible values for a column</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<h3>The SQL AND &#38; OR Operators</h3>

<blockquote>
The AND operator displays a record if both the first condition AND the second condition are true.
</br>
The OR operator displays a record if either the first condition OR the second condition is true.
<h4>AND Example</h4>
SELECT * FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE Country='Germany'
</br>
AND City='Berlin';
</blockquote>

<blockquote>OR Example</br>
SELECT * FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE City='Berlin'
</br>
OR City='München';
</blockquote>

<blockquote>BOTH Example</br>
SELECT * FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE Country='Germany'
</br>
AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');
</blockquote>

<h2>The SQL IN Operator</h2>

<p>
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
</p>

<h4>The IN Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT column_name(s)</br>
FROM table_name
</br>
WHERE column_name IN (value1,value2,...);
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City of "Paris" or "London":
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE City IN ('Paris','London');
</blockquote>

<h3>The SQL SELECT TOP Clause</h3>

<p>
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
</p>

<p>
The SELECT TOP clause can be very useful on large tables with thousands of records.
        Returning a large number of records can impact on performance.
</p>

<p>
Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause.
</p>

<h4>SQL Server / MS Access Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
        FROM table_name;
</blockquote>

<h2>The SQL LIKE Operator</h2>

<p>
The LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
</p>

<h4>SQL LIKE Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT column_name(s)</br>
FROM table_name
</br>
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with the letter "s":
</p>
<h4>LIKE Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE City LIKE 's%';
</blockquote>

<p>
Tip: The "%" sign is used to define wildcards (missing letters) both before and after the pattern.
</p>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City ending with the letter "s":
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE City LIKE '%s';
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a Country containing the pattern "land":
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE Country LIKE '%land%';
</blockquote>

<p>
*Will return countries like Ireland, Iceland, Switzerland, etc…
</p>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a Country NOT containing the pattern "land":
</p>

<h4>NOT LIKE Example</h4>
<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Customers
</br>
WHERE Country NOT LIKE '%land%';
</blockquote>

<h3>The SQL BETWEEN Operator</h3>

<p>
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a range. The values can be numbers, 
        text, or dates.
</p>

<h4>SQL BETWEEN Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT column_name(s)</br>
FROM table_name
<br/>
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20:
</p>

<h4>BETWEEN Example</h4>
<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Products
</br>
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
</blockquote>

<p>
To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:
</p>

<h4>NOT BETWEEN Example</h4>
<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Products
</br>
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20, 
        but products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3 should not be displayed:
</p>

<h4>BETWEEN with IN Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Products
</br>
WHERE (Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20)
</br>
AND NOT CategoryID IN (1,2,3);
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName beginning with any of the letter BETWEEN 'C' and 'M':
</p>

<h4>BETWEEN with Text Value Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Products
<br/>
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'C' AND 'M';
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate BETWEEN '04-July-1996' 
        and '09-July-1996':
</p>

<h4>BETWEEN Date Value Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Orders
<br/>
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/04/1996# AND #07/09/1996#;
<br/>
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'C' AND 'M';
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate BETWEEN 
        '04-July-1996' and '09-July-1996':
</p>

<h4>BETWEEN Date Value Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Orders
</br>
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/04/1996# AND #07/09/1996#;
</blockquote>

</div>

<h2>Organizing data</h2>

<h3>The SQL ORDER statement</h3>

<h4>The SQL ORDER BY Keyword</h4>

<p>
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set by one or more columns.
            The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort 
            the records in a descending order, you can use the DESC keyword.
</p>

<h4>ORDER BY Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT column_name,column_name</br>
FROM table_name
</br>
ORDER BY column_name,column_name ASC|DESC;
</blockquote>

<p>
following example selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the 
            "Country" column:
</p>

<h4>ORDER BY Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT * FROM Customers</br>
ORDER BY Country;
</blockquote>

<p>
following example selects all customers from the "Customers" table, 
            sorted DESCENDING by the "Country" column:
</p>

<h3>ORDER BY DESC</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>SELECT *</br>
FROM Customers
</br>
ORDER BY Country DESC;
</blockquote>

<h3>ORDER BY MULTIPLE COLUMNS</h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT *
<br/>
FROM Customers
<br/>
ORDER BY Country,CustomerName;
</blockquote>

<h3>The GROUP BY Statement</h3>

<p>
The GROUP BY statement is used in conjunction with the aggregate functions to 
            group the result-set by one or more columns.
</p>

<h4>The SQL GROUP BY Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
<br/>
FROM table_name
<br/>
WHERE column_name operator value
<br/>
GROUP BY column_name;
</blockquote>

<p>
Now we want to find the number of orders sent by each shipper.
</p>
The following SQL statement counts as orders grouped by shippers:
<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName,COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
<br/>
LEFT JOIN Shippers
<br/>
ON Orders.ShipperID=Shippers.ShipperID
<br/>
GROUP BY ShipperName;
</blockquote>

<p>
We can also use the GROUP BY statement on more than one column, like this:
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, Employees.LastName,
<br/>
COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
<br/>
FROM ((Orders)
<br/>
INNER JOIN Shippers
<br/>
ON Orders.ShipperID=Shippers.ShipperID)
<br/>
INNER JOIN Employees
<br/>
ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID)
<br/>
GROUP BY ShipperName,LastName;
</blockquote>

<h3>The SQL HAVING Clause</h3>

<p>
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not 
            be used with aggregate functions.
</p>

<h4>SQL HAVING Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
<br/>
FROM table_name
<br/>
WHERE column_name operator value
<br/>
GROUP BY column_name
<br/>
HAVING aggregate_function(column_name) operator value &#59;
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement finds if any of the employees has registered more than 10 orders:
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM (Orders)
<br/>
INNER JOIN Employees
<br/>
ON Orders&#46;EmployeeID&#61;Employees&#46;EmployeeID)
<br/>
GROUP BY LastName
<br/>
HAVING COUNT(Orders&#46;OrderID) &#62; 10&#59;
</blockquote>

<p>We add an ordinary WHERE clause to the SQL statement&#58;</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
<br/>
INNER JOIN Employees
<br/>
ON Orders.EmployeeID&#61;Employees.EmployeeID
<br/>
WHERE LastName&#61;&#39;Davolio&#39; OR LastName&#61;&#39;Fuller&#39;
<br/>
GROUP BY LastName
<br/>
HAVING COUNT(Orders&#46;OrderID) &#62; 25&#59;
</blockquote>

</div>

<div id="third">

<h2>Working with functions</h2>

<h3>The AVG() Function</h3>

<p>
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.
</p>

<h4>SQL AVG() Syntax</h4>

<p>SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name</p>

<h3>SQL COUNT() Function</h3>

<p>
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria.
</p>

<h4>SQL COUNT(column_name) Syntax</h4>

<p>
The COUNT(column_name) function returns the number of values (NULL values will not be counted) of the specified column:
</p>

<p>SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;</p>

<h3>The SUM() Function</h3>

<p>
The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column.
</p>

<h3>SQL SUM() Syntax</h3>

<p>SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;</p>

</div>

<div id="fourth">
<h2>Retrieveing Data from Multiple Tables</h2>

<h3>The SQL JOIN</h3>

<p>
An SQL JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based 
        on a common field between them. The most common type of join is: SQL INNER JOIN 
        (simple join). An SQL INNER JOIN return all rows from multiple tables where the 
        join condition is met.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
<br/>
FROM Orders
<br/>
INNER JOIN Customers
<br/>
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
</blockquote>

<h3>Different SQL JOINs</h3>

<p>
Before we continue with examples, we will list the types the different SQL JOINs you can use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
</li>
<li>
LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
</li>
<li>
RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
</li>
<li>
FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The SQL INNER JOIN Keyword</h3>

<p>
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there 
        is a match between the columns in both tables.
</p>

<h3>The SQL INNER JOIN Syntax</h3>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name(s)
<br/>
FROM table1
<br/>
INNER JOIN table2
<br/>
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
</blockquote>

<p>OR</p>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name(s)
<br/>
FROM table1
<br/>
JOIN table2
<br/>
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
</blockquote>

<p>PS! INNER JOIN is the same as JOIN.</p>

<p>
The following SQL statement will return all customers with orders:
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
<br/>
FROM Customers
<br/>
INNER JOIN Orders
<br/>
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
<br/>
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
</blockquote>

<p>
Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there 
        is a match between the columns. If there are rows in the "Customers" table that do 
        not have matches in "Orders", these customers will NOT be listed.
</p>

<h3>The SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword</h3>

<p>
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table (table1), with 
        the matching rows in the right table (table2). The result is NULL in the 
        right side when there is no match.
</p>

<h3>The SQL LEFT JOIN Syntax</h3>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name(s)
<br/>
FROM table1
<br/>
LEFT JOIN table2
<br/>
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
</blockquote>

<p>OR</p>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name(s)
<br/>
FROM table1
<br/>
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
<br/>
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
</blockquote>

<p>PS! In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
<br/>
FROM Customers
<br/>
LEFT JOIN Orders
<br/>
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
<br/>
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
</blockquote>

<p>
Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the left table (Customers), 
        even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).
</p>

<h3>The SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword</h3>

<p>
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all rows from the right table (table2), with 
        the matching rows in the left table (table1). The result is NULL in the left 
        side when there is no match.
</p>

<h4>The SQL RIGHT JOIN Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name(s)
<br/>
FROM table1
<br/>
RIGHT JOIN table2
<br/>
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
</blockquote>

<p>OR</p>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name(s)
<br/>
FROM table1
<br/>
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2
<br/>
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
</blockquote>

<p>PS! In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.</p>

<p>
The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they have placed:
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.FirstName
<br/>
FROM Orders
<br/>
RIGHT JOIN Employees
<br/>
ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID
<br/>
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
</blockquote>

<p>
Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the right table 
        (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).
</p>

<h3>The SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword</h3>

<p>
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table (table1) 
        and from the right table (table2). The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword combines the 
        result of both LEFT and RIGHT joins.
</p>

<h3>The SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax</h3>

<blockquote>
SELECT column_name(s)
<br/>
FROM table1
<br/>
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
<br/>
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;
</blockquote>
The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:
<blockquote>
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
<br/>
FROM Customers
<br/>
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
<br/>
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
<br/>
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
</blockquote>

<p>
Note: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the left table (Customers), 
        and all the rows from the right table (Orders). If there are rows in "Customers" that do 
        not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in 
        "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.
</p>

</div>

<div id="fifth">

<h3>The SQL INSERT INTO Statement</h3>
<p>
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
</p>
<h4>The SQL INSERT INTO Syntax</h4>
<p>
It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two forms.
        The first form does not specify the column names where the data will be inserted, 
        only their values:
</p>

<blockquote>
INSERT INTO table_name
<br/>
VALUES (value1,value2,value3,&#46;&#46;&#46;);
</blockquote>

<p>
The second form specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted:
</p>

<blockquote>
INSERT INTO table_name (column1,column2,column3,...)
<br/>
VALUES (value1,value2,value3,&#46;&#46;&#46;);
</blockquote>

<h4>INSERT INTO Example</h4>

<p>Assume we wish to insert a new row in the "Customers" table.</p>

<blockquote>
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
<br/>
VALUES (&#39;Cardinal&#39;,&#39;Tom B. Erichsen&#39;,&#39;Skagen 21&#39;,&#39;Stavanger&#39;,&#39;4006&#39;,&#39;Norway&#39;);
</blockquote>

<h4>INSERT INTO specified columns Example</h4>

<p>
It will insert a new row, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", 
        and "Country" columns
</p>

<blockquote>
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
<br/>
VALUES (&#39;Cardinal&#39;, &#39;Stavanger&#39;, &#39;Norway&#39;);
</blockquote>

<h3>The SQL UPDATE Statement</h3>

<p>
The UPDATE statement is used to update existing records in a table.
</p>

<h4>SQL UPDATE Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>
UPDATE table_name
<br/>
SET column1=value1,column2=value2,..
<br/>
WHERE some_column=some_value;
</blockquote>

<p>
** The WHERE clause specifies which record or records that should be updated. 
        If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be updated
</p>

<p>
Assume we wish to update the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" with a new 
        contact person and city.
</p>

<h4>UPDATE Example</h4>

<blockquote>
UPDATE Customers
<br/>
SET ContactName=&#39;Alfred Schmidt&#39;, City='Hamburg'
<br/>
WHERE CustomerName=&#39;Alfreds Futterkiste&#39;&#59;
</blockquote>

<h3>The SQL DELETE Statement</h3>

<p>The DELETE statement is used to delete rows in a table.</p>

<h4>SQL DELETE Syntax</h4>

<blockquote>
DELETE FROM table_name
<br/>
WHERE some_column=some_value;
</blockquote>

<p>
Assume we wish to delete the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table.
</p>

<h4>DELETE Example</h4>

<blockquote>
DELETE FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste' AND ContactName='Maria Anders';
</blockquote>

<h4>Delete All Data</h4>

<p>
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. 
        This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:
</p>

<blockquote>DELETE FROM table_name;</blockquote>

<p>OR</p>

<blockquote>DELETE * FROM table_name;</blockquote>

<p>
Note: Be very careful when deleting records. You CANNOT undo this statement!
</p>

<div id="sixth">
<h2>SQL Wildcard Characters</h2>

<p>
In SQL, wildcard characters are used with the SQL LIKE operator.
        SQL wildcards are used to search for data within a table.
</p>

<p>With SQL, the wildcards are:</p>
%  =  A substitute for zero or more characters
<br/>
_ = A substitute for a single character
<br/>
[charlist] = Sets and ranges of characters to match
<br/>
[^charlist] OR [!charlist] = Matches only a character NOT specified within the brackets
<br/>

<h4>SQL % Wildcard</h4>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "ber":
        %
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';
</blockquote>

<h4>Using the SQL _ Wildcard,</h4>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting 
        with any character, followed by "erlin":
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE City LIKE '_erlin';
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", followed by any character, followed by "on":
</p>
_
<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';
</blockquote>

<h6>Using the SQL [charlist] Wildcard</h6>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":
        [charlist]
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with
        "a", "b", or "c": [charlist]
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';
</blockquote>

<p>
The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City NOT 
        starting with "b", "s", or "p":
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';
</blockquote>

<p>OR</p>

<blockquote>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<br/>
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
</blockquote>
