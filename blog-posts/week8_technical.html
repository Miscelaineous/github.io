	<h1>Recursion<h1>

		<h2>What is it?</h2>

		<p>It is a routine that calls itself in a repetitive routine.  It's a straight-forward definition but it can become incredibly complex in practice.</p>

		<h2>When do you use it?</h2>

		<p>It is often used as a way to iterate through data.  As such, it is an alternative to loops and functions that do the same.</p>

		<p>It is best used for large tasks that can be broken down into repetitive "sub-tasks" &#45; the "base case" being the smallest size without calling itself.</p>


		<h2>How do you use it?</h2>

			<p>You need to take a function, say def count as below, and then call that function within the function (if n>).  You must remember to stop calling it (count(n-1)) within the function too!</p>

			<blockquote>def count (n):</br>
			if n > 0:</br>
			print n</br>
			count (n-1)</br>
			else:</br>
			print "Done"</blockquote>

			<p>But don't take my word on this.  Here is an engaging video from Khan Academy that explains all.</p>
