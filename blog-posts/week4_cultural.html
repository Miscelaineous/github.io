	<h2>Where are all the women programmers&#46;&#46;&#46;?</h2>

<article id = "facts">

	<h3>Let&#39;s start with the facts</h3>

		<p>This summer has seen a plethora of gender diversity stats from global tech giants and the results are not good.  Across the board, it appears that woman represent only <strong>30&#37;</strong> of the workforce.<a href="file:///Users/elainefinn/github.io/blog-posts/Week4_cultural2.html" target="_blank"><em> Read more&#46;&#46;&#46;</em></a></p>

	<h3>What are the issues?</h3>

	<h4>Education and formative years</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Encouragement</b> &#45; Women (and girls) need more positive reinforcement throughout their education and careers.  With stereotype threats being managed where identified, and encouragement to pursue STEM related activities from a young age.</li> 
			<li><strong>A lack of role models</strong> &#45; there need to be more.  Whilst <strong>Sandra Bullock&#39;s</strong> role as an an astronaut in the Academy Award&#45;winning <em>Gravity</em> goes someway to help reposition the female scientist stereotype, STEM and coding careers need to be positioned as engaging, highly fulfilling and impactful pursuits that can be very lucrative.  Software engineers can earn six figures from graduation.  And a multi&#45;million dollar paycheck could come your way if you get that app up and running&#46;&#46;&#46;!</li>

		</ul>

	<h4>The techie perception</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><strong><em>Programming is boring</em></strong> &#45; the perception being that programming is simply about tapping away on a keyboard all day.  The creative, problem&#45;solving and application of programming, which now touches most roles in most industries, from proposition design through to sales and marketing, needs to be promoted more.</li>  
			<li><strong><em>Programming is hard</em></strong> &#45; there&#39;s no denying it&#59; it is.  However, lots could be done to make the subject more accessible to the female intellect and mindset.  Men typically focus on the &#34;do&#34;, whilst women typically focus on the &#34;why&#34; and &#34;how&#34;.  Computer Science and software eductional materials and approaches don&#39;t necessarily help with this approach, with a focus on jargon and geeks teaching geeks in a style that only geeks get.  I once asked a coding lecturer what instantiating a variable meant, to the response, <em>&#34;it&#39;s when you take a variable and instantiate it&#34;</em>.  And I&#39;m not kidding.  This simply isn&#39;t good enough.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>The WorkPlace</h4>
			
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Brogrammers Boys Club</strong> &#45; the tech world has been accused of trying to keep their male geek cultures in a way that goes beyond recruitment barriers.  Studies show that female coders often feel (and indeed are) marginalized in the workplace, with less say, less resources and less respect being granted to female techies, epitomised by a 20&#37; gender pay gap.  And as female techies either aren&#39;t granted access these workplaces or leave them pretty quickly, the reasons of &#34;poor cultural fit&#34; &#45; are cited, to further distract workplace cultures from the key issues.</li> 
			<li><strong>If you can&#39;t beat them, <em>find another way</em></strong> &#45; whilst the recent tech company gender stats might encourage more balanced recruitment policies going forward, I would also encourage women to see beyond the Facebooks and Twitters of this world.  Every business and activity is being innovated, and often disrupted, by software technology.  The opportunities to evolve existing businesses, or create new ones, have never been so prolific.  And with technology comes flexibility and the ability to create from your kitchen, meaning that coding careers can be highly complementary to other life aspirations and demands.  An impactful and lucrative contribution to the Digital Economy can be made in many ways without becoming a Google employee.</li> 
		</ul>

	<h3>What are the solutions?</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Repositioning of the stereotype</strong> &#45; the commissioning of more programs and films with positive leading female role-models.  This together with more prominence of the variety and breadth of corporate and entrepreneurial careers that would benefit from having basic coding skills.</li>
		<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> &#45; the focus on programming in the school curriculum will reap singificant benefits for women in tech in the future.  Meanwhile, there is a plethora of woman who are capable, experienced and are well suited to programming, and&#47;or digital roles (where even a basic level of programming will give you the edge).  Coding isn&#39;t just, nor should be marketed solely, for kids.</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>Summary</h3>

		<p>The Digital Economy is upon us.  Even a basic level of understanding of programming will enable women to exploit digital to increase levels of creativity, empowerment, earning capacity and impact in today&#39;s world.  But the eco&#45;system has yet to fully exploit this and requires more investment, prominence and policies to engage the female workforce.</p>
