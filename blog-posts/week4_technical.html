    <h2><strong>Ruby vs Javascript</strong></h2>

		<li>Ruby is an intepreted language, vs compiled language, which means that a separate compiler is not required, albeit at the cost of slightly slower performance.</li>

		<li>Ruby is object-orientated, to the extent that every element is treated as an object.</li>

		<li>Ruby is at the heart of the Ruby on Rails framework, albeit it doesn't have to run on this.</li>

		<li>Files are saved as .rb so that text editors, such as Sublime, can recognise the text as Ruby code.</li>

		<li>Interesting Fact: The name Ruby was chosen by Matz as it was a colleague's birthstone.</li>

		<ul>
			
		<li>Javascript is a functional language that also heavily relies on the naming and defining of objects.</li>
		
		<li>Its key strength is its ability to be run on a browser, with interactions, amendments and updates also possible, facilitating web-app interactivity.  This makes Javascript incredibly dynamic in nature.</li>

		<li>Interesting Fact: Javascript was developed under the name Mocha.</li>

		</ul>

	<h4><em><strong>Summary</strong></em></h4>

		<p>Javascript has regained in popularity over the last few years as a rich and dynamic way to develop web apps, with enhanced interactivity features.  Hence it's increasing use by web developers.</p>  

		<p>Ruby is a simple, easy to read and understand code.  It focuses on slick tools and developers are increasingly adopting it.  However, it's not necessarily a good place for beginners to start, particularly with the lack of syntax and syntactic sugar which make fundamental coding concepts and rules hard to learn.</p>

		<p>A combination of both appears to be a good starting point for wannabe developers.</p>

	<h3><strong>Looping</strong></h3>

	<h4><em><strong>What is it?</strong></em></h4>

		<p>Iteration is when a code is repeated to avoid duplicating the code in a program.  It facilitates efficiency both in keep the code readible and short but also in facilitating its maintainence in the future.</p>

		<p>It is a concept driven by the need to branch within a code i.e. to create code that a program runs should a condition be true or a condition be false.</p>

	<h4><em><strong>What are the options?</strong></em></h4>

		<p>There are many ways to iterate or "loop" within Code.  There are many reasons driving the choice of loop, the first being whether the number of times required to loop is known or not.</p>

		<ul>
		
		<li><strong>For loop</strong> &#45; when a condition is checked to see if it is true and the number of times needed to iterate is known.</li>
						
		<li><strong>Times loop</strong> &#45; this is a compact For loop, again useful if number of iterations is known.</li>

		<li><strong>While loop</strong> &#45; the code keeps running whilst the while condition is true, without needing to know the number of iterations.</li>

		<li><strong>Until loop</strong> &#45; this is the reverse of the While loop, the code keeps running until the until condition is true.</li>

		<li><strong>Each loop</strong> &#45; this instructs the code to iterate through each item in an array, checking the method condition against each item.</li>

		</ul>

	<p>The above loops all return a copy of an element, elements or values from an array whilst maintaining the original array.  The following return a new array.</p>

		<ul>

		<li><strong>Select loop</strong> &#45; this is also an array but returns a new array, which is subset of an array.</li>

		<li><strong>Map loop</strong> &#45; returns a transformed value by applying a function to each element, e.g. transforming 70% to 0.70.</li>
			
		<li><strong>Fold/Inject/Reduce loop</strong> &#45; this reduces an array to a single value, that doesn't match the values in the array, e.g. the sum of an array.</li>	

		</ul>

	<h4><em><strong>Summary</strong></em></h4>

		<p>Looping is a dynamic and efficient way to re-use code within a program.  The type of loop is determined by the data structure in place, the activity and outcome required and the level of performance desired.</p>
