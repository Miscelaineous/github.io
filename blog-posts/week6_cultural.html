	<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>	

	<h3>What is it?</h3>

	 	<p>Stereotype threat is where intellectual abilities are negatively impacted by stereotype, i.e. a group&#45;based limitation, perceived or otherwise, e.g. race, sex, age, mental health etc.  It is not a deliberate act, it is the unconscious underperformance of perceived minorities, as a result of the threat of belonging to a stereotype.  It is deemend a contextual condition &#45; a woman may feel differently about their identity in a setting where woman are a majority, vs a minority.</p>

	<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>

	 	<p>Under&#45;performance as a result of identity is an issue that can and should be addressed to ensure equality of experience and potential for all.  More specifically, it is deemed by some a major contributor to the imbalance of women in STEM, and computer science and software, careers.  And further, when it comes to approaching tech companies or working in the tech industry, stereotype threat can encourage woman to think they don't belong there.</p>

	<h3>What relevant experiences have you had?</h3>

		<p>I have found myself in male&#45;orientated corporate environments, many of which have been quite aggressive, throughout most of my career.  I have witnessed on many occasions my, and that of my fellow female colleagues, either a hesitancy or over&#45;compensation in work&#45;place approach.</p>

	<h3>Have you felt a physically reaction to this threat?</h3>

	 	<p>Yes, I have often felt huge physical reactions to feeling intimidated in an aggressive male&#45;orientated environment, often without realising it until leakage occurs, often in the form of an overly&#45;strong presence and response being presented, in an attempt to maintain the balance.  More commonly, women may engage in a range of behaviours from presenting themselves less confidentally, suggesting they are less competent, through to retreating and eventually retiring from the work&#45;place.</p>

	<h3>What can be done about it?</h3>

		<p>Steretype threat causality is complex and often difficult to isolate, amongst other factors that may affect performance, including behaviour reinforced by the group itself (Mother: <em>&#34;you should marry well vs explore a STEM career&#34;</em>).  For me, I ultimately left these environments.  I struggle with robust and real solutions for the more aggressive corporate environments where there are proportionately more men, particularly in senior positions, than women.  Diversity committee and the promotion of women to more senior positions can help, but often the women who achieve these positions have accepted, and sometimes adopted, the mannerisms that propagate this threat.  Compensatory behaviours can help, with more encouragement, mentorship and support for women throughout their careers.  But fundamentally, my sense is that ensuring a more balanced gender&#45;aware approach to recruitment and promotion is needed, together with more diversity training and awareness for the dominant stereotype, which for this article is men.</p>
