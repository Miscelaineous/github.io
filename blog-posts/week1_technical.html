<h1>Why are these your favorite sites?</h1>

	<div id="answer">

	<div class="BBC">
	<img src="https://www.smartairmedia.com/content/images/stories/appicons/icon-bbcnews.png"></img>
	<p>This is my key source for news within the UK and around the world.  It's easy to navigate, is smart about its headlines and content, and informative.  It is visually easy to read and interpret and with no advertising, is 'noise-free'.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="LinkedIn">
	<img src="http://pauldanielsinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/linkedin_000.png"></img>
	<p>This is my key source of updates regarding work contacts, colleagues (old and new) and friends.  It keep me appraised of key professional activities and helps me to reach out to new resources and keep in touch with old ones.  It is easy to use and its search facility, enabling me to track down resource and contacts from all over the world, is impressive.</p>

	<div cass="SkillsCrush">
	<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52db4966e4b049da57009d29/t/5303efa7e4b025aa2fd09a47/1392766889223/skillcrush-logo1.jpg"></img>
	<p>This female-focused website, largely written by women for women, is presented in an easy to understand and non-geeky way which results in coding fundamentals being easier to understand and absorb.</p>

	</div>

<h1>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</h1>

	<div id="answer">

	<div class="BBC">
	<img src="https://www.smartairmedia.com/content/images/stories/appicons/icon-bbcnews.png"></img>
	<p>I am immediately drawn to the burgundy banner and BBC emblem, which generate a comforting response from me as I recognise and identify with the brand.  Regarless of where I am in the world, I find it brings me a sense of attachment to what is going on in the world and at home.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="LinkedIn">
	<img src="http://pauldanielsinteriors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/linkedin_000.png"></img>
	<p>As Linked In comprises my contacts, colleagues and friends, I am immediately drawn to their photos and posts, updating me (and all) of their professional thoughts, activities and events.</p>
	</div>

	<div cass="SkillsCrush">
	<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52db4966e4b049da57009d29/t/5303efa7e4b025aa2fd09a47/1392766889223/skillcrush-logo1.jpg"></img>
