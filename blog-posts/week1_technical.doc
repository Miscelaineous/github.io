BBC - this is my key source for news within the UK and around the world.  It's easy to navigate, is smart about its headlines and content, and informative.  It is visually easy to read and interpret and with no advertising, is 'noise-free'.

Linked In - this is my key source of updates regarding work contacts, colleagues (old and new) and friends.  It keep me appraised of key professional activities and helps me to reach out to new resources and keep in touch with old ones.  It is easy to use and its search facility, enabling me to track down resource and contacts from all over the world, is impressive.

SkillsCrush - this woman-focused website is so relevant to my current needs, to learn coding as a woman, by women.  It articulates its content in an easy to understand and very visual way, appealing to one of my learning styles.
