		<p>Having experienced 2-3 years of frustration as I tried to work with, in and amongst techies, and tech companies, in an attempt to realize my own entrepreneurial aspirations, it was time to check out what all the fuss is about.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Time to work out why good devs were hard to find, and charged nicely for the privilege of using their services.</li>

			<li>Why I felt I always had to &#39;sell&#39; the project/job concept and technical details vs simply quoting a price for work, i.e. devs appeared to be recruiting me!</li>

			<li>And why there were so few women around to choose from?  Someone who can explain the why and the how, instead of just the do!</li>

		</ul>

		<p>So, having tinkered with HTML and CSS over the last year or so, and having confidently got CodeAcademy&#39;s HTML/CSS track under my belt, I was ready, yes?  Ready to take coding a little more seriously.</p>

		<p>So where and how?  Well, if I&#39;m going to do this, then an intensive bootcamp has to be the best way to get an overall education on the full-stack environment, learn the jargon and demystify the world of code in the shortest amount of possible time.<p>

		<p>And where better to learn code, than at the mothership.  I&#39;ve watched the Social Network.  I've watched the Intern.  San Francisco it is - away from all the distractions of the UK.</p>

		<p>And through a combination of luck and good fortune with a sprinkling of intellect (?), charisma (?) and hunger to learn (!), I managed to secure a place on the prestigious Dev Bootcamp, one of the best intensive coding programs in the US.  So 9 weeks of intensive coding &#39; bring it on.</p>

		<p>Awesome!</p>

		<p><em>Now you must do the prep.</em></p><p>Prep?  I beg your pardon?  I completed my HTML/CSS codeacademy course.  I&#39;m match fit.</p>

		<p><em>Sorry, HTML/CSS is &#34;not&#34; coding, you only build a web page with those?</em></p>

		<p>Ah</p>

		<p><em>To build a web &#34;app&#34; you need to know the full-stack environment, so your tools (Chrome Dev Tools, Browsers, Text Editors, Command Line, GitHub, Driver Codes).  To know your front end, you need advanced HTML/CSS, Javascript, UX, UI.  For your backend, you need at least Ruby, Node, SQL, Server Landscapes.  At least.</em></p>

		<p>Ah</p>

		<p><em>And you need to know all the basics, say first 20 &#37; &#34;before&#34; you start the course?</em></p>

		<p>Erm, ok.</p>

		<p><em>It usually takes 9 weeks of pre course prep, sometimes more.</em></p>  
		<p>Sorry?</p>

		<p><em>We also cover blogging, social media, engineer empathy, communication skills, all taught through a multi&#45;disciplinary learning styles of video, audio, lectures, pair and solo coding.  We even throw yoga and mindfulness in.</em></p>

		<p>Right.  Erm, taxi to the airport please!</p>

		<p>My return flight to the UK was non&#45;changeable and non&#45;refundable.  So I took a deep breath and started.</p>

		<p>The workload was pretty intense, diverse, complex and at times pretty overwhelming.  Somethings I got it, many things I didn&#39;t.  Most I revisited, a few I put in a dark box under the bed only to rear its ugly head at assignment time.</p>

		<p>There was plenty of support on hand through pair programming and from the college.  But it&#39;s like a marathon, you still have to run it yourself.  This was going to be one of the toughest things I&#39;ve ever done (particularly without a CS degree or any real coding experience) and I&#39;ve done a few crazy things in my time.</p>  

		<p>I looked long and hard at my return flight.  Maybe I could sweet&#45;talk someone at the airline.  Fake an illness?  A death?  Maybe I just buy another ticket&#46;&#46;&#46;</p>

		<p>And then I watched Shareef&#39;s video &#45; I&#39;d saved it for half way through Phase 0 &#45; because I somehow missed it amongst avalanche of materials.  And I listened and I exhaled.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Shareef wants students to be <em<strong>in the kitchen and not at the restaurant table</strong></em<strong>; to have an apron and hat on, not a menu in their hand.</p>

		<p>Feeling stupid is ok.  Feeling like the dunce of the class is ok.  Thinking that you&#39;ve been accidentally enrolled, is ok.  Most people feel the same.  Ok, there&#39;s the MIT and Harvard CS grads that may see newbies like me as someone to avoid...  But if they new it all, they wouldn&#39;t be on the course either.   I exhaled further.</p>

		<p>And everyone hits the program at different speeds and with different experience &#45; hence a focus on the heavy prep, so that you&#39;ve got the first 20 &#37; under your belt before walking in the classroom.  Something I hadn&#39;t expected (in my mad dash to get over to San Fran and &#39;get on it&#39;) but makes total sense, even if this is a baptism of fire approach to the coding world!</p>

		<p>He wants students to walk in &#34;hungry, mad and inspired&#34;, well I&#39;m definitely all of those.  Co&#45;creation is an essential part &#45; a philosophy I have been banging on about for an age.  &#34;Go fast, go alone; go together, go far&#34;.</p>

		<p>I am loving what this man has to say and his approach to education and how best to learn to code.  It&#39;s as much about learning the landscape, mindset and communication skills, as the coding know&#45;how, all required to succeed.  Yeah, I&#39;m nervous as hell.  But that&#39;s ok.  So is everyone else.</p>

		<p>So I took a breath.  Got some sleep.  Opened my pc up at dawn&#39;s crack, again.  And said, I&#39;m going to give this my best shot.  And I will.<p>
