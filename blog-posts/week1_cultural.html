		<p>Having experienced 2-3 years of frustration working in, amongst and around techies, in an attempt to realize my own entrepreneurial aspirations, it was time to check out <strong>what all the fuss is about.</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Time to work out why good devs (aka software engineeres/programmers/geeks) charge big bucks for the privilege of using their services.</li>

			<li>Why, notwithstanding my Zuckerberg-like ideas(!), when recruiting for programmers, I always felt that they were recruiting me&#46;&#46;&#46;</li>

			<li>Why there were so few women around to choose from?  Someone who can explain the why and the how, instead of just the what!</li>

			<li>And why the only language spoken was that of geek&#45;speak.  Is there a gentleman's agreement (nod to last point) to only communicate using computer science and mathematical jargon, even when discussing web&#45;app development with (smart!) non &#45;techies?</li>

		</ul>

		<p><strong>It was time to demystify coding.</strong>  To throw a spotlight on the realities and try to understand why the crux of the evolvement and penetration of the digital economy, appears to be the preserve of so few, clever(?), men(!)</p>

		</div>

		<p>So, having tinkered with HTML and CSS via some basic workshops and on &#45;line coding tutorials, I decided I was ready to take web&#45;app development on.  And if I was going to do this, I needed to be distraction&#45;free.  It was time to hit a <strong>coding bootcamp.</strong></p>

		<p>Coding bootcamps have emerged all over the world  &#45; 9 or 12 week intensive coding experience, where total beginners can immerse themselves in the full&#45;stack experience to learn some skills, improve their job opportunities and even spin into more entrepreneurial activities  &#45; we all have a winning app in us, yes?</p>

		<p>Sadly, London and the UK are somewhat limited on choice and so where better to learn, than at the &#34;software mothership&#34;, San Francisco.  I&#39;ve watched the Social Network, the Intern and have already visited Silicon Valley.  It was the right place to head, and through a combination of luck and good fortune with a sprinkling of intellect(?), charisma(?) and hunger to learn(!), I managed to secure a place on the prestigious Dev Bootcamp, one of the best intensive coding programs in the US.</p>

		<p>9 weeks of intensive coding from start to finish &#45; bring it on.</p>

		</div>

		<p><b>Well, not quite.</b>  It transpires that the bootcamp model relies on students doing quite a bit of prep beforehand.  Let me quantify that further.  For Dev Bootcamp, this means 9 weeks of full&#45;on study (20&#39;25 hours quoted but for the non-computer science grad, it was substantially more&#46;&#46;&#46;) <strong>BEFORE</strong> I&#39;ve walked into a classroom.</p>

		<p>This was unexpected and in some respects a little disappointing.  As I slaved at home working my way through the huge volume of algorithms and trying to understand alien concepts, such as TDD (<em>anyone?</em>), I did wonder if I&#39;d been &#34;sold a pup&#34;.  Surely the whole point of a coding course is that you learn to program on thecourse.  However, it appears that most of these schools are requiring that students learn the first 20&#37; at home themselves.</p>

		<p><strong>Shereef Bishay</strong>, Dev Bootcamp&#39;s founder, explains that this enables everyone to get to a level playing field before starting (albeit it's accepted that there will always be experienced participants vs newbies to coding like myself starting the course).  This not only facilitates the classroom experience for all, but improves the chances of graduates securing a job post the course.</p>

		<p>However, learning the first 20&#37; of any subject, largely by yourself, <strong>is hard</strong>.  This combined with the volume of assignments and pair&#45;coding you&#39;re required to complete, as well as the blogs to research and write, not forgetting learning both Ruby and Javascript basics (together with a plethora of developers software and toolkits), highlighted that this is <strong>not</strong> for the weak&#45;hearted.</p>

		<p>More than once, I questioned my motivations, intellect, critical thinking capabilities, workload management (and I&#39;ve got a work&#45;horse reputation!).  I just didn&#39;t (and still don&#39;t know) if I can do this.  And to find out through an intense bootcamp like this one, you&#39;ve got to really want to master this stuff to put yourself through it.  I don&#39;t mind admitting that, more than once, I checked my return flight to see if it was refundable.  (<em>Seriously, TDD, anyone?!?</em>).  And then I watched Shareef&#39;s video and I exhaled&#46;&#46;&#46;</p>

		<p>Shareef wants students to be <em><strong>in the kitchen and not at the restaurant table</strong></em>; to have an apron and hat on, not a menu in their hand.</p>

		<p>Feeling stupid is ok.  Feeling like the dunce of the class is ok.  Thinking that you&#39;ve been accidentally enrolled, is ok.  Most people feel the same.  Ok, there&#39;s the MIT and Harvard CS grads that may see newbies like me as someone to avoid&#46;&#46;&#46;  But if they knew it all, they wouldn&#39;t be on the course either.   I exhaled further.</p>

		<p>And everyone hits the program at different speeds and with different experience &#45; hence a focus on the heavy prep, so that you&#39;ve got the first 20&#37; under your belt before walking in the classroom.  Something I hadn&#39;t expected (in my mad dash to get over to San Fran and &#39;get on it&#39;) but makes total sense, even if this is a baptism of fire approach to the coding world!</p>

		<p>He wants students to walk in &#34;hungry, mad and inspired&#34;, well I&#39;m definitely all of those.  Co&#45;creation is an essential part &#45; a philosophy I have been banging on about for an age.  &#34;Go fast, go alone; go together, go far&#34;.</p>

		<p>I am loving what this man has to say and his approach to education and how best to learn to code.  It&#39;s as much about learning the landscape, mindset and communication skills, as the coding know&#45;how, all required to succeed.  Yeah, I&#39;m nervous as hell.  But that&#39;s ok.  So is everyone else.</p>

		<p><strong>And I get it.</strong>  The model is pretty disruptive to traditional forms of education and it did make me wonder how many other vocational programs would benefit from such an approach...?</p>

		<p>The materials were largely comprehensive and the range of subjects, skill&#39;sets and software you are introduced to is awe-inspiring, if not a little overwhelming at times.  And the reality is, if you&#39;re serious about learning a new skill, then there is no escaping the hard work required.</p> 

		<p>So I took a breath.  Got some sleep.  Opened my pc up at dawn&#39;s crack, &#34;again&#34;.  And said, I&#39;m going to give this my best shot.  <strong>And I will.</strong><p>
