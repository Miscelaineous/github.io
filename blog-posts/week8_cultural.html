	<h2>Dealing with conflict</h2>

		<p>I feel pretty uncomfortable discussing this issue, so will do so briefly, and generically.</p>

		<p>Long story short?  I struggle with conflict.  As much in the same way that anyone else does (albeit there are some crazies that dine out on causing upset).</p>

		<p>But the real reason is because I have historically been pretty bad at handling it and I think some reasons include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>I'm not very good at saying no or expressing how I feel in certain situations &#45; this lack of expressing how I feel, over the longer term, can result in pent up frustration.</li>

			<li>I'm pretty low maintanence and not overtly needy in how I go about my life.  Sadly this can attract the more manipulative souls out there into my life.  And not being a master of the dark arts myself (nor having any desire to be), has meant that my arsenal of responses has been somewhat limited when dealing with some of the poor behaviour that has arisen.</li>

			<li>I have high expectations of myself and the people around me, particularly when it comes to friendship and relationships.  I suspect too high on occasion.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>How can I improve?</h2>

		<p>There is little substitute for time and experience and my attitude to conflict has changed drastically from where it was even a few years ago.  But there are a number of strategies I still employ:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Trust</strong> &#45; I've learnt to trust a little less.  Whilst the debate of "do you know you are bad" remains unresolved, I think we all like to think that human beings are good at heart.  However, the reality is that people lie, are selfish and will exploit others at the first opportunity.  Even the best natured can find themselves in situations where such behaviour becomes unavoidable.  So I guess I've learnt to employ a more "healthy detachment" towards those around me.</li>

			<li><strong>Expression</strong> &#45; I try to highlight how I feel earlier on in a potential conflict situation.  I try to say how I feel to the right person, in the right way at the right time and place.  I'm still working on that...</li>

			<li><strong>Acceptance</strong> &#45; I increasingly accept that conflict is a part of life.  Not everyone gets on.  Not everyone feels the same way about issues.  And we all have our own (valid) perspectives.  So whilst I try to respect that of others, I am also increasingly trusting of my own instincts too.  And regardless of the outcome, I try to ensure I am at peace with my role in the issue.</li> 
		</ul>

		<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

			<p>Conflict stems from many sources: how we feel about an issue, how an issue impacts any number of parties, and dealing with others' conflict when impacting us.  Each require a different level of understanding, empathy and strategy.</p>

			<p>And whilst the idea of the world "getting on" is an inspirational one, my sense is the more realistic option is to avoid causing hurt to others where possible; to be honest but kind; and to sleep well at night from your own actions.  We can but try.</p>
