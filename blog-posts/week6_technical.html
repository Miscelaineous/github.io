<h1>Functional programming</h1>

	<h2>What is it?</h2>

		<p>Summary &#45; functional program is an approach to programming that lists all codes in a step&#45;by&#45;step way, mixing up data (variables) and behaviours (functions) as and when they occur in the chronological process.</p>

		<p>Functional programming evaluates mathematical functions via expressions.  Pure functional programming eliminates &#34;side effects&#34; (i.e. changes on the state that do not depend on function inputs), so it can be much easier to understand and predict, as the same functions when re&#45;applied result in the same value.  As such, it describes a desired result, commonly referred to as &#34;declarative programming&#34;.</p>  

		<p>Functional programming is believed to have evolved out of lamda calculus, &#34;a formal system of mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on functions&#46;&#46;&#46; and variables&#46;&#46;&#46; &#34; (Wikipedia).</p>

		<p>It was created to support the functional or procedural approach to problem&#45;solving, which details every step a computer must take to achieve a goal (also called &#34;algorithmic programming&#34;).  It&#39;s akin to a long procedure sheet of code which mixes up data and behaviours throughout.</p>

	<h2>How does it work?</h2>

		<p>You define carefully the input to each function and what each function returns..  It&#39;s a form of declarative programming.</p>

	<h2>What are its advantages?</h2>

		<p>Because each function is specifically designed to perform a specific task given its arguments, it is easy to read and maintain.</p>

		<p>And because of this readability and ease of maintenance, it is also easier to iterate with new designs, whereby functions can be tested in isolation.</p>

	<h2>What languages use it?</h2>

		<p>Haskell, Miranda, Clean.</p>

<h1>Object&#45;Orientated programming</h1>

	<h2>What is it?</h2>

		<p>Summary &#45; object&#45;orientated (OO) programming is an approach to programming that separates different steps into self&#45;contained units, containing data (variables) and behaviours (methods) that relate to that unit only.  It&#39;s essentially a program of mini&#45;programs.</p>

		<p>OO programming is believed to be an off&#45;shoot from procedural programming.  It is built on the concept of self&#45;contained units, called &#34;objects&#34;, whereby data (variables) and its behaviour (functions) are encapsulated &#45; this means the actions of one object cannot interfere with those of another (unless specifically manipulated to do so).</p>

		<p>By hiding this data not directly accessible by other parts of the program, methods are required to enable encapsulated data to be accessed (and manipulated).  These objects point back to classes, which are designed in &#34;class hierarchies&#34;.</p>  

		<p>Classes are ideas, blueprints or concepts that facilitate the creation of these objects (they are akin to sets and subsets arising from Set Theory, in mathematics).  Other key principles include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Dynamic dispatch</strong> &#45; where the object determines the code to be run by looking up the method.</li>
			<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong> &#45; all data structures are connected in some way, and via this modular approach to data structure, facilitates class and object hierarchy and inheritance.</li>
			<li><strong>Open recursion</strong> &#45; whereby larger problems can be solved by splitting them into sub&#45;problems and then combine all the results to solve the original problem (i.e. the &#34;divide and conquer&#34; approach).</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>What are its advantages?</h2>

		<p>OO programming is particularly useful for when there is a fixed set of operations for a program.  It facilitates the addition of new mini&#45;programs to the original program.  For instance, new classes (in-built or developer&#45;created) can be added to implement existing or new methods.</p>

	<h2>What languages use it?</h2>

		<p>Ruby, Python, Javascript, Perl, PHP and Objective&#45;C.</p>

	<h2>So which one?</h2>

		<p>There are many key reasons why OO programming has gained popularity of late:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Scope benefits</strong> &#45; the concept of scope, which limits the definition of and use of variables and methods within classes &#45; reduces secuirty issues, i.e. the risk of error as changing a variable or method only impacts the class to which it relates.  With procedural programming, where code is not grouped together in this ordered fashion, any changes to variables or methods can impact the whole program, increasing secsurity risks substantially.</li>
			<li><strong>Efficiency</strong> &#45; because of the above limitions arising from scope, maintenance costs are substantially reduced as the code needs only be changed in a targetted manner, due to the organisational formatting of OO, vs in a blanket manner, as required for functional programming.</li>
			<li><strong>Readability</strong> &#45; the OO approach to segmenting code is good for separation of logic and the readibility of the code accordingly.</li>
		</ul>
