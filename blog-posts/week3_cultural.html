	<h4><strong>Question 1 &#45; <em>Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn.</em></strong></h4>

		<p>I am an awkward myriad of many learning styles.  As reflected in Gregorc's Mind Styles &#45; which show an even spread of learning styles, with Abstract Sequential dominating (which is alarmingly spot on!!).</p>

		<p>This is good in many respects as it means I respond well to diverse learning materials and formats.  However, this can be a challenge to as it means for each subject, I am watching videos, reading, applying practical know-how whilst trying to attend a course too!  An overwhelming approach at times.</p>

		<p>When it comes to fundamental concepts, I need time.  Time to conceptualise, analyse and then put into practice.  Once I'm there, I fly.  But this means that Prep O is a really important stage for me.  I have been immersing myself in all the (comprehensive) materials and resources available, and this takes time.  But time well spent as it means that when I get it, I really do.</p>
	
	<h4><strong>Question 2 &#45; <em>Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it&#39;s related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.</em></strong></h4>

		<p>The volume of work has been pretty overwhelming.  I&#39;ve never done course pre&#45;work like it (and neither have many others).  Unsure how I would cope if I wasn&#39;t on this full&#45;time, which I am now.  But I am used to tough workloads, so I know I&#39;ll get on top of it all.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m having to bring a different mindset to the table.  Understanding maths and logic is one thing, understanding computer coding and logic is quite another.  Object-orientation has been quite tricky to get my head around, but I am getting there.  It is all starting to make sense, albeit every application exercise sends me into a tizz again&#46;&#46;&#46;</p>

		<p>I have found some of the resources pretty tough to follow.  There is a lot of assumed knowledge and when providing information about Javascript, there's a comparison to Ruby or Java, which is fine if you're masters of those &#59; not much use if you are learning all.  I find the style of materials quite tough to follow at times &#59; with a focus on  &#34;do &#34; vs  &#34;why &#34; or  &#34;how &#34;.  A boy vs girl approach.</p>

		<p>Fundamental differences between non-programmers and programmers, non&#45;programmers don't know how a computer or program works. Instead did teaching languages, how about we reach that. His once you understand object&#45;orientation and a DOM, then you're away, yes? Maybe that's the point&#46;&#46;&#46;</p>

		<p>My actions are to review all materials from all perspectives &#45; I Google everything, including definitions as often common words have a different meaning in a mathematical or computing perspective.</p>

		<p>I tend to conceptualise then apply but see that the intensity of my course might not allow that so trying to get by conceptualising (re basics) out of the way before starting.</p>

	<h4><strong>Question 3 &#45; <em>now, consider the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.</em></strong></h4>

		<p>I understand the concept and have experienced both mindsets in my professional career.  However, I think the article, and philosophy, does not fully appreciate that notwithstanding the benefits of a growth mindset, it's not always as simple as this.  My sense is that the following is assumed:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>that all hygiene factors have been met - it's not always possible to do the work you love if you have a mortgage to pay and a family to support.</li>
			<li>that we all have boundless energy and solid self esteem to bounce back from the inevitable consequences of a growth mindset, i.e. that you become vulnerable, put yourself in positions and places where you might not thrive initially (or at all), and that the feedback you receive, whilst constructive (and kindly put) isn't always positive.  You need a strong constitution to embrace this approach and not everyone has that.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4><strong><em>Final observations &#45; Men focus on do. Women on the how and re way.</em></strong></h4>

		<p>Most programming tutorials &#45; and I&#39;ve watched a lot &#45; still focus on the do. And still assume you know how a computer and a program works.  Even the most basic of tutorials skip over some of the logistics basic logistics that can leave a beginner lost for hours, and use &#34;the same&#34; jargon to explain the jargon being used!</p>

		<p>It is time the coding educational ecosystem recognised and comprehensively responded to these barriers to improve accessibility across the genders.</p>
